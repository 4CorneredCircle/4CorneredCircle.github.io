          I love reading books. I do it ALL the time. So on this website, I'm
          going to review books that I've read. I'll try my best to give honest,
          fair reviews with some plot elements and some overall critique.

          <span class="faq">Q: Do any of your reviews contain spoilers?</span>
          <br />
          A: There will never be anything I consider spoilers in any of my
          reviews. I want to give everyone the chance to experience the books
          for themselves! If you are very concerned about spoilers, though, read
          the book first and then come back to see what I said about it!

          <span class="faq">Q: Who are you?</span> <br />
          A: I am just a teenage book enthusiast who also enjoys coding. I
          decided to combine those interests by making this website from scratch
          using GitHub Pages.
