      I anticipated for this project to take a lot longer than it did, but I am here today to tell you that <a href="booklist.html">my booklist</a> is now done! Once I sat down with the intention
      to do it, it came really easily. And then the code for it wasn't too hard and, since I had time on my hands, I got it done pretty quickly! Check it out if you're interested, and happy reading!
      <br><br>

      I know it has only been a few hours since the last update, but I am back with some much-needed improvements to the site. The redesign of the homepage to add the live updates box
      broke all of the formatting I had done for mobile viewing. I put up a haphazard yellow box that would cover the screen when someone tried to view it on mobile, but obviously that 
      was just a temporary band-aid. So, I have been hard at work today trying to fix the site. It is looking better, but there are still some kinks that need ironing out. It is usable
      on mobile again, though, so I am ripping the band-aid off and allowing people to view it again. Hopefully it looks ok on your device, but if it doesn't, please know that I am working
      on it and maybe just view the site on your desktop for now. <br><br>
      In other news, the Reviews page is getting pretty long, and I wanted an easy way for people to return to the top without having to scroll all the way back up. I looked up a tutorial,
      and we now have a "Return to Top" button that appears when you scroll down to the first review. I hope this improves your reading experience!<br><br>
      Those are all the updates for now! See you later! <br><br>
      <b>1/26/21</b><br>
      Welcome to the Live Updates box! I thought that the constant banners announcing my new reviews were getting a little bit old, so I came up with an idea
      to have a little box on the home screen where I can tell you what's new on the site! It has the added bonus of being a space for any news - not just new reviews. I hope you like
      it and keep an eye on this space for updates in the future!
      <br><br>
      To kick off the grand opening of the updates box, I have an exciting announcement: I am finally starting work on <a href="booklist.html">my booklist</a>! The page has been empty
      for a long time now, and I thought it would be a good idea to either do something with it or get rid of it. I am really excited, because I have always loved the idea of being able
      to share my favorite books of all time with all of you. It should be coming (fairly) soon, so even more reason to watch these updates!
      <br><br>
      Until then, check out my <a href="reviews.html#nyxia">new review of Nyxia</a>, a science-fiction adventure sure to please fans of Ender's Game. Thanks for reading and I'll see you
      soon!
