        <h1>What is Chessboxing???</h1>
        <p>
          Chessboxing is the weird and cool sport you've never heard of! Players
          alternate rounds of chess and boxing. There are up to 11 rounds,
          starting with a 4 minutes chess round followed by 2 minutes of boxing.
          Between rounds is a one minute break where players change their gear.
          The history of chessboxing is a weird one. It was started in 1992 by a
          cartoonist, and that's just the beginning! For more, visit
