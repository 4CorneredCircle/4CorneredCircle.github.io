# 4CorneredCircle.github.io

This is a pet project of mine. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I thought it would be fun to make my own website using GitHub pages. It is a book review website,
because I enjoy reading books and I thought it would be fun to share my opinions on them. I am personally a big fantasy reader as I'm sure you'll be able to tell!

As I said earlier, I am new to GitHub and coding so any tips/ideas would be greatly appriciated! Thanks for your interest!
