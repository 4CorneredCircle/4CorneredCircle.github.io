#Book Reviews

This is a pet project of mine. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I thought it would be really fun and worth the time to create my own website using GitHub pages by the help of these three languages HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
This Website is all about Book Reviews . 
In Brief ,
You can get to know about my personal honest reviews on any book (I reviewed ) you would want to know .
Reading those reviews will help you get a clarity and a precise knowledge of what impression a particular book has made in my mind so you wont have to be in chaos when choosing a right book for a purchase or online read.
Because I enjoy and have a keen interest in reading books so I would love to share my opinions on them. I am personally a big fantasy reader as I'm sure you'll be able to tell!

As I said earlier, I am new to GitHub and coding so any tips/ideas would be greatly appriciated! Thanks for your interest!
I hope you are having a good day ! Be Kind ! Spread love and knowledge !
NOW GO AND ENJOY READING MY BOOK REVIEWS ON MY WEBSITE !!
