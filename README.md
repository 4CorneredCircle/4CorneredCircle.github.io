#Book Reviews

This is a pet project of mine. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I thought it would be fun to make my own website using GitHub pages. It is a book review website,
because I enjoy reading books and I thought it would be fun to share my opinions on them. 

On the website you can find honest reviews on all the books I've read recently, and what impression they made on me.
Reading these reviews can help you gain clarity on the subject and writing of the book and help you make the difficult decision of what book to purchase or read next!
I am personally a big fantasy and science fiction reader, so if you are also interested in either of these genres, I am sure you will find something interesting here!

As I said earlier, I am new to GitHub and coding so any tips/ideas would be greatly appriciated! Thanks for your interest and have a great day! Happy reading!
