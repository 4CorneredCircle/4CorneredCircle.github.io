            Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is a classic Artemis Fowl book. It is the 4th book in the Artemis Fowl series, and mostly follows the tried and 
            tested model of the previous books; there is a big bad guy and Artemis has to foil their plan with the help of Captain Holly Short and her 
            fairy technology. This time there's a few thrilling differences, though. Artemis has had his mind wiped of all his memories of the fairy world, and 
            Captain Short is framed for a terrible crime. The rest of the fairy world thinks Holly is an out of control fugitive, but Holly knows the truth:
            Opal Koboi is back at large. Holly is powerless to alert the LEP because she is still an accused suspect for murder. And Opal has a new plan, one 
            that could jeopardize the existences of fairy and human kind alike. Holly has to find Artemis, help him restore his lost memories, and stop Opal once again.
            Will Opal finally outsmart the boy genious? Will Artemis recover his old memories at all? Find out in my new favorite book in the series, Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception.
