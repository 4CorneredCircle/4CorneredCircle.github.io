            <u class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: This review will utterly confuse anyone unfamiliar with the world of The Sorceress and the previous books. I highly recommend this series, so go read those first and then return to hear what I have to say!</u> <br/>
            The Sorceress is the 3rd book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series. As with every book in the 6 part series, this book is incredibly action-packed and so enthralling you feel like you are right next to the main characters
            at every turn. At the exposition, Nicholas and the newly Awakened twins have left Paris for London. Nicholas hopes that there he will be able to find Gilgamesh, who can teach Sophie and Josh the magic of water. What Flamel conveniently leaves out when telling his plan to the twins is that
            Gilgamesh is 10,000 years old and largely insane. Their journey is sure to be met with dangerous foes because London is the Magician John Dee's home city and stronghold. Dee is desperate to capture Flamel and the twins because he knows what will happen if he fails again.

            Meanwhile,
            in San Fransisco, Perenelle has been imprisoned on Alcatraz along with a host of terrifying monsters. New immortal beings join the cast of characters when the legendary Billy the Kid and Niccolo Machiavelli are assigned to oversee her demise. 
            Perenelle must fight for her life, even as every use of her aura brings her closer to death's door.

            Once again, author Michael Scott displays amazing mastery of the fantasy genre as he blends many of the world's most popular myths into one stunning series. This book and series is a must-read for any fan of fantasy or mythology. Percy Jackson and Harry Potter beware! There's another cowboy in town!

            Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is a classic Artemis Fowl book. It is the 4th book in the <i>Artemis Fowl</i> series, and mostly follows the tried and 
            tested model of the previous books; there is a big bad guy and Artemis has to foil their plan with the help of Captain Holly Short and her 
            fairy technology. This time there's a few thrilling differences, though. Artemis has had his mind wiped of all his memories of the fairy world, and 
            Captain Short has been framed for a terrible crime. The rest of the fairy world thinks Holly is an out of control fugitive, but Holly knows the truth:
            Opal Koboi is back at large. Holly is powerless to alert the LEP because she is still an accused suspect for murder. And Opal has a new plan, one 
            that could jeopardize the existences of fairy and human kind alike. Holly has to find Artemis, help him restore his lost memories, and stop Opal once again.
            Will Opal finally outsmart the boy genious? Will Artemis recover his old memories at all? Find out in my new favorite book in the series, Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception.
