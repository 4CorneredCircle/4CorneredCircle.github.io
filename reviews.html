            Well everyone, we have made it to book 5 in this amazing series, <i>The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i>. 
            I am sorry to say that despite its outstanding predecessors, this book is not quite everything it promises to be.
            But let's save that for the end. For now, let's talk about the plot. <br> <br>
            The book picks up right where the last left off: Sophie and Josh have been separated, Nicholas is on his deathbed, 
            and Dee is madly assembling his next plan. Josh is in disbelief after watching his sister whip the seemingly beautiful and
            innocent Archon Coatlicue, and Sophie is shocked after she sees Josh intentionally choose Dee and Dare over his own twin
            sister. John Dee fled his Enoch Enterprises office after his attempt at unleashing Coatlicue backfires, and makes his way to Alcatraz,
            with Virginia Dare and Josh in tow. Meanwhile, Sophie, unconcious Nicholas, Perenelle, and Niten decide to visit Tsagaglalal, She who Watches. <br> <br>
            This is where my problem with this book comes in. What I just described is the majority of the story of this book. Most of this book starts to feel
            like filler content, just to get everything in place for the final book. There are a few exciting moments, but they are drowned out by a mass of
            uninteresting text, used just to pad the book out and make sure something is happening in both Sophie and Josh's storylines. I understand that the
            author had a vision for the series that he needed to set up by the final book, but this book makes the series seem not well thought out and just 
            biding time until the grand finale. On top of that, the author introduces many new things to the universe without any previous set up or excplanation
            for how it could work. All of this is in stark contrast to the previous books, on which I wrote, <i>"Where other authors might throw a crazy twist in at the end of a book without any previous
            context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
            exciting."</i> This book throws all that out the window in favor of pushing its characters into specific places and roles, often without much justification.
            This is most apparent in one line of the book: "For some reason he didn't quite understand, Josh was still reluctant to let Dee know he had the pages [of the codex]."
            That is <u>not</u> an explanation for Josh's actions. You cannot just push it away and hope the readers forget about it. You need a direct explanation that makes sense
            given what you've told or showed us before. It is moments like these that totally ruin the reader's immersion in the book, which is one of the things I loved the most 
            about this series. <br> <br>
            All in all, this book is still an ok book and it has a good enough cliffhanger to make me want to see the conclusion of the series, but it is not getting any best in series
            awards from me. For the fact that I love this series and am excited for the end, I will give this book 3.5 stars.

            <span class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: This review will utterly confuse anyone unfamiliar with the world of The Necromancer and the previous books. I highly recommend this series, so go read those first as well as my review of the previous book, <a href="#sorceress">The Sorceress</a>, and then return to hear what I have to say!</span> <br/>
            The Necromancer is the 4th book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series, 
            and it just might be the best yet. Let's get right into the plot. At the end of the previous book, 
            Nicholas and the twins had finally been reunited with Perenelle in San Fransisco. Now they have two tasks:
            defend the city from the army of monsters waiting on Alcatraz, and continue the twins training by teaching Josh
            the magic of fire. But the twins' blind faith in Nicholas and Perenelle is starting to fade and they find themselves questioning
            how much they can trust the immortals. Meanwhile, Scathach and Joan are trapped 11,000 years in the past. They are holding off 
            the creatures' attacks, but they are out-numbered and have no supplies. At some point, something has to give. John Dee is still at large, 
            but after failing his previous mission, he turns his loyalty away from the Dark Elders and devises a desperate plan that could be crazy enough
             to finally work. If it fails, it would endanger all life on Earth and all of the bordering shadowrealms.<br> 
            <br>
            Author Michael Scott deftly molds all his characters, even as their numbers grow larger. He gives them each a distinct, and 
            intriguing personality that makes them all have a reason to be in the story. He also gives them a realistic motive that makes
            his fantastical stories more believable by giving them a touch of human emotion. <br>
            <br>
            The claim I made at the beginning of the review is true. This <i>could</i> very well be the best book in the series so far, and all because of 
            the plot twists. With not one but two magnificently devised plot twists, this book will leave your heart racing and you yearning to see what happens next.
            My favorite thing about them, though, is that they <u>make sense</u>. Where other authors might throw a crazy twist in at the end of a book without any previous
            context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
            exciting. If this prospect is appealing to you, I <i>highly</i> reccomend this book. Enjoy!

            The Sorceress is the 3rd book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series. As with every book in the 6 part series, this book is incredibly action-packed and so enthralling you feel like you are right next to the main characters
            at every turn. At the exposition, Nicholas and the newly Awakened twins have left Paris for London. Nicholas hopes that there he will be able to find Gilgamesh, who can teach Sophie and Josh the magic of water. What Flamel conveniently leaves out when telling his plan to the twins is that
            Gilgamesh is 10,000 years old and largely insane. Their journey is sure to be met with dangerous foes because London is the Magician John Dee's home city and stronghold. Dee is desperate to capture Flamel and the twins because he knows what will happen if he fails again. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Meanwhile,
            in San Fransisco, Perenelle has been imprisoned on Alcatraz along with a host of terrifying monsters. New immortal beings join the cast of characters when the legendary Billy the Kid and Niccolo Machiavelli are assigned to oversee her demise. 
            Perenelle must fight for her life, even as every use of her aura brings her closer to death's door. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Once again, author Michael Scott displays amazing mastery of the fantasy genre as he blends many of the world's most popular myths into one stunning series. This book and series is a must-read for any fan of fantasy or mythology. Percy Jackson and Harry Potter beware! There's another cowboy in town!

            Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is a classic Artemis Fowl book. It is the 4th book in the <i>Artemis Fowl</i> series, and mostly follows the tried and 
            tested model of the previous books; there is a big bad guy and Artemis has to foil their plan with the help of Captain Holly Short and her 
            fairy technology. This time there's a few thrilling differences, though. Artemis has had his mind wiped of all his memories of the fairy world, and 
            Captain Short has been framed for a terrible crime. The rest of the fairy world thinks Holly is an out of control fugitive, but Holly knows the truth:
            Opal Koboi is back at large. Holly is powerless to alert the LEP because she is still an accused suspect for murder. And Opal has a new plan, one 
            that could jeopardize the existences of fairy and human kind alike. Holly has to find Artemis, help him restore his lost memories, and stop Opal once again.
            Will Opal finally outsmart the boy genious? Will Artemis recover his old memories at all? Find out in my new favorite book in the series, Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception.
