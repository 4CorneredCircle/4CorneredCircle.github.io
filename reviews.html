          One for the Murphy’s: One for the Murphys is a children's novel about the hardships and struggles of foster
          care. The main character, Carly, is forced into foster care after being abused by her stepdad. One thing you
          must know before you know the plot of this book is that Carly’s biological family is not a normal one. They
          are the type of family that goes dumpster diving for clothes instead of going to a store. They’re the type
          of
          people that could care less about education. Knowing this, I will now explain why you needed to know this.
          After Carly's family is not able to care of her anymore, she is placed with a family that is almost the
          exact
          opposite of what Carly is used to. The family she is placed with is a loving, kind, and supportive family.
          Carly isn’t happy being in foster care in the first place, but being in an environment like this one makes
          the
          experience a whole lot worse. While with the Murphy’s, Carly learns how to be less stubborn and support the
          people in her life. She has to adapt to their ways of living whether she likes it or not. In the long term
          though, the Murphy's end up changing Carly’s life forever and the memories she made with them will be with
          her
          forever. That’s all I’m going to tell you so you’ll have to read the book to find out more. Happy reading!

        <h1>Gemina</h1>
        <h2>By: Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff</h2>
        <p id="gemina-info" style="text-align: center;">(Click Anywhere to Expand or Retract)</p>
        <p id="gemina-text">
          Oh Amie and Jay, you've done it again. Not only did you manage to craft a wonderful sequel to the fantastic
          "Illuminae", but you made it feel brand new and exciting by adding new characters and ideas that genuinely
          surprise us. You continue to push the boundaries of the science-fiction genre, while also sticking to some of
          its more tried and true basic elements. Keep doing what you're doing. Ok now without any further elongated
          introductions, let's get right into my review of Gemina, book 2 in the Illuminae Files series. <br> <br>

          Gemina immediatly makes apparent the fact that we are not following Kady, Ezra, or the Hypatia again. Instead
          we are now seeing what has been happening on the Heimdall, a stationary jump gate that leads to and from the
          Kerenza system, as well as a few others. Heimdall is essentially a giant ring that rotates around a wormhole
          at its center. It is home to a large number of people, most of which are off-station due to a holiday. This,
          combined with the fact that the wormhole has been taken offline for maintenance, is the perfect setup for a
          certain corporation with malevolant intent to stage a hostile takeover... <br> <br>

          Now let's turn to the delightful characters of this tale. First up we have Hanna Donnelly (17), the pampered
          and spoiled daughter of Heimdall's commander, Charles Donnelly. Her father's idea of a good time is training
          her tactical thinking and fighting skills and they spend hours in sims together doing just that.
          Hanna gets almost everything she wants and is expected to be the well-mannered example for the station. But
          looks can be decieving, as she hides a few things from her loving dad: she likes to spice up parties with
          some dust, an illegal euphoric drug. She gets her treats from Nik Malikov. <br> <br>

          Nik Malikov (18) is a member of a large crime family known as the House of Knives. Nik is a jokester and can
          lighten any situation. The HoK breeds a parasite on the Heimdall that secretes a substance used to make dust.
          The parasite can be extremely dangerous if left unchecked, but the HoK always remembers to check... Right?
          <br> <br>

          When BeiTech decides to "liquidate" the jump station and its inhabitants so that news about their attack on
          Kerenza IV will never get out, Hanna and Nik must put aside their differences and work together to survive.
          As their story starts to become entwined with Kady and Ezra's, a thrilling phenomena occurs where you get to
          witness two stories you love merge into one amazing novel. The only reason why I gave this book a 4.5 is
          becauase I didn't quite feel the same brilliant energy and thrill as I did in the first book. That should not
          stop you from reading this book, though. A perfectly fitting addition to the world of the Illuminae Files,
          Gemina is a truly great book.

          Hello readers! Right after I finished reviewing The Warlock, I put a hold on the final book in the series, The
          Enchantress. I always need a book to read, though, so while I waited I decided to pick up a
          series that I have been meaning to read for a long time. This is the first book in that series and I am
          delighted to say that it made such an impact on me that I knew I had to review it soon. I hope you enjoy! <br>
          <br>
          As I was thinking about how best to write this review, I decided I wanted to keep in on the shorter side. Not
          because I don't have a lot to say, but because I believe the best impact this review could have on you
          would be to make you want to read this book without giving too much away. This simple idea gets to the root of
          what is amazing about this book. Its story lives in the spaces between your knowledge. It thrives in the gaps,
          as you try to piece together what is really happening. At this point I am probably confusing you, so lets get
          into the plot and I'll show you what I mean. <br> <br>
          This book is pretty hard-core science fiction, and it wastes no time getting to the point. Main characters
          Kady and Ezra live in a small colony on an icy planet at the edge of the galaxy called Kerenza IV. The
          colony's main purpose is to mine
          a valuable material called Hermium for it's parent company, Wallace Ulyanov Consortium (WUC). There's only one
          small problem: the colony is illegal under United Terran Authority (UTA) laws. BeiTech, a competitor of WUC,
          finds out
          about the colony and instead of reporting it to the UTA, decides to launch an all-out attack on the colony to
          claim its valuable resources for itself. And this is where we catch up with Kady and Ezra. As missles rain
          down from the sky,
          Kady and Ezra must fight their way to an evacuation ship. Oh, and Kady just broke up with Ezra. <br>
          <br>
          This review <i>barely</i> scratches the surface of this book, but I hesitate to give you anymore information
          about it. It is truly an amazing book, and if you are an avid reader of science fiction, you are sure to love
          it.
          Plot twist, after plot twist after plot twist leaves you entirely confused but incredibly engaged, and when
          the pieces start to come into place you will be left with an amazed grin for days. I hope you enjoy, and I
          will be
          back soon with a review of the next book, Gemina! Happy reading!

        <p id="warlock-text">
          Well everyone, we have made it to book 5 in this amazing series, <i>The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas
            Flamel</i>.
          I am sorry to say that despite its outstanding predecessors, this book is not quite everything it promises to
          be.
          But let's save that for the end. For now, let's talk about the plot. <br> <br>
          The book picks up right where the last left off: Sophie and Josh have been separated, Nicholas is on his
          deathbed,
          and Dee is madly assembling his next plan. Josh is in disbelief after watching his sister whip the seemingly
          beautiful and
          innocent Archon Coatlicue, and Sophie is shocked after she sees Josh intentionally choose Dee and Dare over
          his own twin
          sister. John Dee fled his Enoch Enterprises office after his attempt at unleashing Coatlicue backfires, and
          makes his way to Alcatraz,
          with Virginia Dare and Josh in tow. Meanwhile, Sophie, unconcious Nicholas, Perenelle, and Niten decide to
          visit Tsagaglalal, She who Watches. <br> <br>
          This is where my problem with this book comes in. What I just described is the majority of the story of this
          book. Most of this book starts to feel
          like filler content, just to get everything in place for the final book. There are a few exciting moments, but
          they are drowned out by a mass of
          uninteresting text, used just to pad the book out and make sure something is happening in both Sophie and
          Josh's storylines. I understand that the
          author had a vision for the series that he needed to set up by the final book, but this book makes the series
          seem not well thought out and just
          biding time until the grand finale. On top of that, the author introduces many new things to the universe
          without any previous set up or excplanation
          for how it could work. All of this is in stark contrast to the previous books, on which I wrote, <i>"Where
            other authors might throw a crazy twist in at the end of a book without any previous
            context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well
            thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
            exciting."</i> This book throws all that out the window in favor of pushing its characters into specific
          places and roles, often without much justification.
          This is most apparent in one line of the book: "For some reason he didn't quite understand, Josh was still
          reluctant to let Dee know he had the pages [of the codex]."
          That is <u>not</u> an explanation for Josh's actions. You cannot just push it away and hope the readers forget
          about it. You need a direct explanation that makes sense
          given what you've told or showed us before. It is moments like these that totally ruin the reader's immersion
          in the book, which is one of the things I loved the most
          about this series. <br> <br>
          All in all, this book is still an ok book and it has a good enough cliffhanger to make me want to see the
          conclusion of the series, but it is not getting any best in series
          awards from me. For the fact that I love this series and am excited for the end, I will give this book 3.5
          stars.

        <p id="necromancer-info" style="text-align: center;">(Click anywhere to Expand or Retract)</p>
        <p id="necromancer-text">
          The Necromancer is the 4th book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series,
          and it just might be the best yet. Let's get right into the plot. At the end of the previous book,
          Nicholas and the twins had finally been reunited with Perenelle in San Fransisco. Now they have two tasks:
          defend the city from the army of monsters waiting on Alcatraz, and continue the twins training by teaching
          Josh
          the magic of fire. But the twins' blind faith in Nicholas and Perenelle is starting to fade and they find
          themselves questioning
          how much they can trust the immortals. Meanwhile, Scathach and Joan are trapped 11,000 years in the past. They
          are holding off
          the creatures' attacks, but they are out-numbered and have no supplies. At some point, something has to give.
          John Dee is still at large,
          but after failing his previous mission, he turns his loyalty away from the Dark Elders and devises a desperate
          plan that could be crazy enough
          to finally work. If it fails, it would endanger all life on Earth and all of the bordering shadowrealms.<br>
          <br>
          Author Michael Scott deftly molds all his characters, even as their numbers grow larger. He gives them each a
          distinct, and
          intriguing personality that makes them all have a reason to be in the story. He also gives them a realistic
          motive that makes
          his fantastical stories more believable by giving them a touch of human emotion. <br>
          <br>
          The claim I made at the beginning of the review is true. This <i>could</i> very well be the best book in the
          series so far, and all because of
          the plot twists. With not one but two magnificently devised plot twists, this book will leave your heart
          racing and you yearning to see what happens next.
          My favorite thing about them, though, is that they <u>make sense</u>. Where other authors might throw a crazy
          twist in at the end of a book without any previous
          context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well
          thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
          exciting. If this prospect is appealing to you, I <i>highly</i> reccomend this book. Enjoy!

          The Sorceress is the 3rd book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series. As with every book
          in the 6 part series, this book is incredibly action-packed and so enthralling you feel like you are right
          next to the main characters
          at every turn. At the exposition, Nicholas and the newly Awakened twins have left Paris for London. Nicholas
          hopes that there he will be able to find Gilgamesh, who can teach Sophie and Josh the magic of water. What
          Flamel conveniently leaves out when telling his plan to the twins is that
          Gilgamesh is 10,000 years old and largely insane. Their journey is sure to be met with dangerous foes because
          London is the Magician John Dee's home city and stronghold. Dee is desperate to capture Flamel and the twins
          because he knows what will happen if he fails again.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile,
          in San Fransisco, Perenelle has been imprisoned on Alcatraz along with a host of terrifying monsters. New
          immortal beings join the cast of characters when the legendary Billy the Kid and Niccolo Machiavelli are
          assigned to oversee her demise.
          Perenelle must fight for her life, even as every use of her aura brings her closer to death's door.

          <br />
          Once again, author Michael Scott displays amazing mastery of the fantasy genre as he blends many of the
          world's most popular myths into one stunning series. This book and series is a must-read for any fan of
          fantasy or mythology. Percy Jackson and Harry Potter beware! There's another cowboy in town!

          Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is a classic Artemis Fowl book. It is the 4th book in the <i>Artemis Fowl</i>
          series, and mostly follows the tried and
          tested model of the previous books; there is a big bad guy and Artemis has to foil their plan with the help of
          Captain Holly Short and her
          fairy technology. This time there's a few thrilling differences, though. Artemis has had his mind wiped of all
          his memories of the fairy world, and
          Captain Short has been framed for a terrible crime. The rest of the fairy world thinks Holly is an out of
          control fugitive, but Holly knows the truth:
          Opal Koboi is back at large. Holly is powerless to alert the LEP because she is still an accused suspect for
          murder. And Opal has a new plan, one
          that could jeopardize the existences of fairy and human kind alike. Holly has to find Artemis, help him
          restore his lost memories, and stop Opal once again.
          Will Opal finally outsmart the boy genious? Will Artemis recover his old memories at all? Find out in my new
