          Hello readers! Right after I finished reviewing The Warlock, I put a hold on the final book in the series, The
          Enchantress. I always need a book to read, though, so while I waited I decided to pick up a
          series that I have been meaning to read for a long time. This is the first book in that series and I am
          delighted to say that it made such an impact on me that I knew I had to review it soon. I hope you enjoy! <br>
          <br>
          As I was thinking about how best to write this review, I decided I wanted to keep in on the shorter side. Not
          because I don't have a lot to say, but because I believe the best impact this review could have on you
          would be to make you want to read this book without giving too much away. This simple idea gets to the root of
          what is amazing about this book. Its story lives in the spaces between your knowledge. It thrives in the gaps,
          as you try to piece together what is really happening. At this point I am probably confusing you, so lets get
          into the plot and I'll show you what I mean. <br> <br>
          This book is pretty hard-core science fiction, and it wastes no time getting to the point. Main characters
          Kady and Ezra live in a small colony on an icy planet at the edge of the galaxy called Kerenza IV. The
          colony's main purpose is to mine
          a valuable material called Hermium for it's parent company, Wallace Ulyanov Consortium (WUC). There's only one
          small problem: the colony is illegal under United Terran Authority (UTA) laws. BeiTech, a competitor of WUC,
          finds out
          about the colony and instead of reporting it to the UTA, decides to launch an all-out attack on the colony to
          claim its valuable resources for itself. And this is where we catch up with Kady and Ezra. As missles rain
          down from the sky,
          Kady and Ezra must fight their way to an evacuation ship. Oh, and Kady just broke up with Ezra. <br>
          <br>
          This review <i>barely</i> scratches the surface of this book, but I hesitate to give you anymore information
          about it. It is truly an amazing book, and if you are an avid reader of science fiction, you are sure to love
          it.
          Plot twist, after plot twist after plot twist leaves you entirely confused but incredibly engaged, and when
          the pieces start to come into place you will be left with an amazed grin for days. I hope you enjoy, and I
          will be
          back soon with a review of the next book, Gemina! Happy reading!
        </p>

          <span class="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER: This review will utterly confuse anyone unfamiliar with the world of The
            Warlock and the previous books. I highly recommend this series, so go read those first as well as my review
            of the previous book, <a href="#necromancer">The Necromancer</a>, and then return to hear what I have to
            say!</span> <br />
          Well everyone, we have made it to book 5 in this amazing series, <i>The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas
            Flamel</i>.
          I am sorry to say that despite its outstanding predecessors, this book is not quite everything it promises to
          be.
          But let's save that for the end. For now, let's talk about the plot. <br> <br>
          The book picks up right where the last left off: Sophie and Josh have been separated, Nicholas is on his
          deathbed,
          and Dee is madly assembling his next plan. Josh is in disbelief after watching his sister whip the seemingly
          beautiful and
          innocent Archon Coatlicue, and Sophie is shocked after she sees Josh intentionally choose Dee and Dare over
          his own twin
          sister. John Dee fled his Enoch Enterprises office after his attempt at unleashing Coatlicue backfires, and
          makes his way to Alcatraz,
          with Virginia Dare and Josh in tow. Meanwhile, Sophie, unconcious Nicholas, Perenelle, and Niten decide to
          visit Tsagaglalal, She who Watches. <br> <br>
          This is where my problem with this book comes in. What I just described is the majority of the story of this
          book. Most of this book starts to feel
          like filler content, just to get everything in place for the final book. There are a few exciting moments, but
          they are drowned out by a mass of
          uninteresting text, used just to pad the book out and make sure something is happening in both Sophie and
          Josh's storylines. I understand that the
          author had a vision for the series that he needed to set up by the final book, but this book makes the series
          seem not well thought out and just
          biding time until the grand finale. On top of that, the author introduces many new things to the universe
          without any previous set up or excplanation
          for how it could work. All of this is in stark contrast to the previous books, on which I wrote, <i>"Where
            other authors might throw a crazy twist in at the end of a book without any previous
            context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well
            thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
            exciting."</i> This book throws all that out the window in favor of pushing its characters into specific
          places and roles, often without much justification.
          This is most apparent in one line of the book: "For some reason he didn't quite understand, Josh was still
          reluctant to let Dee know he had the pages [of the codex]."
          That is <u>not</u> an explanation for Josh's actions. You cannot just push it away and hope the readers forget
          about it. You need a direct explanation that makes sense
          given what you've told or showed us before. It is moments like these that totally ruin the reader's immersion
          in the book, which is one of the things I loved the most
          about this series. <br> <br>
          All in all, this book is still an ok book and it has a good enough cliffhanger to make me want to see the
          conclusion of the series, but it is not getting any best in series
          awards from me. For the fact that I love this series and am excited for the end, I will give this book 3.5
          stars.

            review of the previous book, <a href="#sorceress">The Sorceress</a>, and then return to hear what I have to
            say!</span> <br />
          The Necromancer is the 4th book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series,
          and it just might be the best yet. Let's get right into the plot. At the end of the previous book,
          Nicholas and the twins had finally been reunited with Perenelle in San Fransisco. Now they have two tasks:
          defend the city from the army of monsters waiting on Alcatraz, and continue the twins training by teaching
          Josh
          the magic of fire. But the twins' blind faith in Nicholas and Perenelle is starting to fade and they find
          themselves questioning
          how much they can trust the immortals. Meanwhile, Scathach and Joan are trapped 11,000 years in the past. They
          are holding off
          the creatures' attacks, but they are out-numbered and have no supplies. At some point, something has to give.
          John Dee is still at large,
          but after failing his previous mission, he turns his loyalty away from the Dark Elders and devises a desperate
          plan that could be crazy enough
          to finally work. If it fails, it would endanger all life on Earth and all of the bordering shadowrealms.<br>
          <br>
          Author Michael Scott deftly molds all his characters, even as their numbers grow larger. He gives them each a
          distinct, and
          intriguing personality that makes them all have a reason to be in the story. He also gives them a realistic
          motive that makes
          his fantastical stories more believable by giving them a touch of human emotion. <br>
          <br>
          The claim I made at the beginning of the review is true. This <i>could</i> very well be the best book in the
          series so far, and all because of
          the plot twists. With not one but two magnificently devised plot twists, this book will leave your heart
          racing and you yearning to see what happens next.
          My favorite thing about them, though, is that they <u>make sense</u>. Where other authors might throw a crazy
          twist in at the end of a book without any previous
          context, Scott lays the groundwork for his twists from the very beginning. They feel deliberate and well
          thought-out which makes their surprise all the more
          exciting. If this prospect is appealing to you, I <i>highly</i> reccomend this book. Enjoy!

            hear what I have to say!</span> <br />
          The Sorceress is the 3rd book in the <i>Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel</i> series. As with every book
          in the 6 part series, this book is incredibly action-packed and so enthralling you feel like you are right
          next to the main characters
          at every turn. At the exposition, Nicholas and the newly Awakened twins have left Paris for London. Nicholas
          hopes that there he will be able to find Gilgamesh, who can teach Sophie and Josh the magic of water. What
          Flamel conveniently leaves out when telling his plan to the twins is that
          Gilgamesh is 10,000 years old and largely insane. Their journey is sure to be met with dangerous foes because
          London is the Magician John Dee's home city and stronghold. Dee is desperate to capture Flamel and the twins
          because he knows what will happen if he fails again.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile,
          in San Fransisco, Perenelle has been imprisoned on Alcatraz along with a host of terrifying monsters. New
          immortal beings join the cast of characters when the legendary Billy the Kid and Niccolo Machiavelli are
          assigned to oversee her demise.
          Perenelle must fight for her life, even as every use of her aura brings her closer to death's door.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once again, author Michael Scott displays amazing mastery of the fantasy genre as he blends many of the
          world's most popular myths into one stunning series. This book and series is a must-read for any fan of
          fantasy or mythology. Percy Jackson and Harry Potter beware! There's another cowboy in town!

            books in the Artemis Fowl series. Go read those first, and then come back to this review!</span> <br />
          Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception is a classic Artemis Fowl book. It is the 4th book in the <i>Artemis Fowl</i>
          series, and mostly follows the tried and
          tested model of the previous books; there is a big bad guy and Artemis has to foil their plan with the help of
          Captain Holly Short and her
          fairy technology. This time there's a few thrilling differences, though. Artemis has had his mind wiped of all
          his memories of the fairy world, and
          Captain Short has been framed for a terrible crime. The rest of the fairy world thinks Holly is an out of
          control fugitive, but Holly knows the truth:
          Opal Koboi is back at large. Holly is powerless to alert the LEP because she is still an accused suspect for
          murder. And Opal has a new plan, one
          that could jeopardize the existences of fairy and human kind alike. Holly has to find Artemis, help him
          restore his lost memories, and stop Opal once again.
          Will Opal finally outsmart the boy genious? Will Artemis recover his old memories at all? Find out in my new
          favorite book in the series, Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception.
